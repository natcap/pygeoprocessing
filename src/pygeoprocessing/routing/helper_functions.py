    """Extract D8 streams based on a flow accumulation threshold.

    Creates an unsigned byte raster where pixel values of 1 indicate the
    presence of a stream and pixel values of 0 indicate the absence of a
    stream. Any flow accumulation pixels greater than ``flow_threshold`` are
    considered stream pixels. Nodata values found in the input flow
    accumulation raster propagate through to the target stream raster.

    Args:
        flow_accum_raster_path_band (tuple): A (path, band) tuple indicating
            the path to a D8 flow accumulation raster and the band index to
            use. Paths may use any GDAL-supported scheme, including virtual
            file system /vsi schemes.
        flow_threshold (number): The flow threshold. Flow accumulation values
            greater than this threshold are considered stream pixels, values
            less than this threshold are non-stream pixels.
        target_stream_raster_path (string): Where the target streams raster
            should be written.
        raster_driver_creation_tuple (tuple): A tuple where the first element
            is the GDAL driver name of the target raster and the second element
            is an iterable of raster creation options for the selected driver.

    Returns:
        ``None``
