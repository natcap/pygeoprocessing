    """Warn if GDAL's cache max size exceeds SLURM's allocated memory.

    This function checks GDAL's max cache (set by the ``GDAL_CACHEMAX``
    environment variable or ``gdal.SetCacheMax()`` function) against the amount
    of memory available to the current SLURM node, identified by the
    ``SLURM_MEM_PER_NODE`` environment variable.

    This function uses a primitive check of environment variables to verify
    whether this function is operating on a SLURM node.  If any environment
    variables have the prefix ``SLURM``, we assume we are running within a
    SLURM environment.

    If the GDAL cache size may exceed the SLURM available memory, then a
    warning is issued.  If ``logging.captureWarnings(True)`` is in effect, a
    warning is logged with the logging system.  Otherwise, the warnings system
    is used directly.
