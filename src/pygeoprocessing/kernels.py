"""A library of kernels for use in ``pygeoprocessing.convolve_2d``.

``pygeoprocessing.convolve_2d`` has some stringent requirements for its kernels
that require a thorough understanding of GDAL and GeoTiffs to be able to use,
including:

    * Kernels must be GDAL-readable rasters, preferably GeoTiffs
    * Kernels must not be striped, and, for more efficient disk I/O, should be
      tiled.
    * The pixel values of a kernel may not represent nodata (GDAL's internal
      way of indicating invalid pixel data)
    * Pixel values must be finite, real numbers.  That is, they may not
      represent positive or negative infinity or NaN.

The functions in this module represent kernels that we have found to be
commonly used, including:

    * Dichotomous kernel: :meth:`dichotomous_kernel`
    * Gaussian (normal) decay kernel: :meth:`normal_distribution_kernel`
    * Linear decay kernel: :meth:`linear_decay_kernel`
    * Exponential decay kernel: :meth:`exponential_decay_kernel`

Additionally, the user may define their own kernel using the helper functions
included here:

    * :meth:`kernel_from_numpy_array`, for kernels where the kernel array is
      already available as a ``numpy`` array, such as those used in common
      image processing operations like sharpening and edge detection.
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)
    * :meth:`create_distance_decay_kernel`, for kernels that are a function of
      distance from the center pixel
